Reflection

The assignment description and brief were well-structured, straightforward, and easy to understand. However, looking back, I feel that more Zoom meetings with practical examples would have been beneficial. I realize now that as students, we could have requested more of these sessions ourselves.

In hindsight, I think it would have been helpful to create a more detailed timeline for completing tasks. It was difficult to estimate how much time each task would take. Sometimes, I would spend several hours fixing what turned out to be a simple typo, while other times I would quickly solve complex problems in just a few minutes.

There was a misunderstanding about the due date of the assignment. I thought it was due on April 14th, which is when the assignment platform closes. However, I later discovered that the actual due date was April 7th. This caused a lot of stress, especially since I had planned to work on improving my website's mobile usability after returning from a holiday on April 6th. I realize that this was my mistake, and I will make sure to double-check deadlines more carefully in the future.

To stay organized, I often copy all the information from Teams and paste it into my personal Notion workspace. While this helps me keep track of everything in my own way, I need to do a better job of staying updated on any changes or updates posted on Teams.
